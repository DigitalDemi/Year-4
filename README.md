# Year 4 Subjects: Image Processing, Distributed Systems, Machine Learning, and Advanced Databases

Hey there! Welcome to my Year 4 GitHub repo. Here’s what I’ve been working on:

Image Processing: Check out my experiments with image analysis and manipulation. I'm diving into algorithms that enhance, filter, and interpret visual data.

Distributed Systems: I’m exploring the design of scalable systems that work across multiple nodes. Reliability and efficiency are key here!

Machine Learning: I’m getting hands-on with different machine learning models and frameworks, focusing on predictive analytics, classification.

Advanced Databases: This part features my work with complex database systems, including Cassandra and graph databases, plus some optimization strategies.
